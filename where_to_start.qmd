New to MapAgora? This page offers guided exploration prompts and learning objectives to help you make the most of the dashboard, whether you're a student, researcher, or curious citizen.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Learning Objectives

After exploring this dashboard, you should be able to:

::: {.callout-tip}
## By the End of Your Exploration

1. **Define civic opportunity** and explain why it matters for democracy
2. **Interpret the civic opportunity index** (1-5 scale) and understand what it measures
3. **Compare counties** within your state and across the country
4. **Identify dominant organization types** in different regions
5. **Recognize data limitations** and evaluate findings critically
:::

#### Key Concepts to Master

| Concept | Where to Learn | Where to Apply |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Civic opportunity definition | [Learn page](learn.qmd#what-is-civic-opportunity) | Interpreting map colors |
| Four dimensions (membership, volunteer, events, action) | [Learn page](learn.qmd#the-four-dimensions-of-civic-opportunity) | Reading sidebar details |
| Organization types | [Learn page](learn.qmd#the-15-organization-types) | Organization type map layer |
| Per capita normalization | [Learn page](learn.qmd#civic-opportunity-per-capita) | Comparing large vs. small counties |
| Data limitations | [Learn page](learn.qmd#data-limitations) | Critical interpretation |

### Guided Map Exploration

Follow these steps to systematically explore the interactive map:

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 1: Find Your Home County
Use the search box in the map to find your county (or a county you're familiar with). Click on it to see details in the sidebar.

**What to observe:**

- What is the civic opportunity index (1-5)?
- How does it rank within the state? Nationally?
- What types of organizations provide civic opportunities?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 2: Interpret the Civic Opportunity Index
Look at the colored boxes (1-5) in the sidebar.

**Questions to consider:**

- Is this county in the top or bottom half nationally?
- How many civic opportunity organizations are there compared to total nonprofits?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 3: Compare with Neighboring Counties
Click on 2-3 neighboring counties.

**Questions to consider:**

- Are there regional patterns?
- Do urban and rural counties differ?
- What might explain differences between neighbors?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 4: Switch to Organization Type View
Use the layer control (top right of map) to switch to "Primary Organization Type."

**What to observe:**

- What organization type dominates your region?
- Are there geographic clusters of certain types?
- How does the organization mix compare to national averages?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 5: Examine Demographic Context
In the sidebar, scroll down to the sociodemographic indicators.

**Questions to consider:**

- How do poverty, education, and broadband access relate to civic opportunity?
- Do counties with similar demographics have similar civic opportunity profiles?
:::

### Guided Table Exploration

Follow these steps to explore the data table systematically:

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 1: Sort by Civic Opportunity Score
Click the "Civic Opp Score" column header to sort counties from highest to lowest.

**What to observe:**

- Which counties have the highest civic opportunity?
- Are they clustered in certain states?
- What are their population sizes?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 2: Filter by Your State
Use the search box to filter to your state (e.g., type "MD" for Maryland).

**Questions to consider:**

- How does your county compare to others in your state?
- What's the range of civic opportunity within your state?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 3: Compare Organization Type Percentages
Scroll right to see the organization type breakdown columns.

**What to observe:**

- What percentage of civic opportunity comes from religious organizations?
- Are there counties dominated by a single organization type?
- How diverse is the civic ecosystem in different counties?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Step 4: Export Data for Further Analysis
Use the export buttons to download data.

**Suggested analyses:**

- Calculate state averages
- Create visualizations in Excel or R
- Compare rural vs. urban counties
:::

### Critical Engagement

MapAgora offers a scalable and comprehensive map of America's civic infrastructure, but no dataset is perfect. This dashboard is an invitation to explore, question, and extend what you see.

#### Ground-Truthing the Data

If you're working in a specific place, try:

- **Click into a few counties** directly on the map
- **Compare with external sources** like Google Maps, Yelp, or local directories
- **Note what might be missing**: informal groups, mutual aid networks, online communities

::: {.callout-warning}
## Questions to Ask

1. **What organizations do you know** that aren't captured here?
2. **Why might they be missing?** (Not registered, no website, P.O. Box address)
3. **How would including them change** the civic opportunity picture?
:::

#### Understanding Structural Limitations

| What MapAgora Captures | What It Might Miss |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| IRS-registered nonprofits | Informal neighborhood groups |
| Organizations with websites | Groups without online presence |
| Organizations with street addresses | Rural organizations using P.O. Boxes |
| Formal membership/volunteer programs | Casual community participation |

These comparisons can help refine place-based research, enrich local knowledge, and spark new questions about what counts—and what is counted—in civic life.

### Explore with Questions

Use these prompts to guide deeper exploration:

#### Regional Patterns
- What kinds of civic opportunity organizations are more common in rural vs. urban counties in your state?
- Are there regional "civic cultures" visible in the data?

#### Inequality and Access
- Which counties have especially high or low civic opportunity scores? What might explain those patterns?
- How does your county compare to others nearby—or to the national average?

#### Critical Reflection
- What does this data confirm or challenge about your understanding of civic life in your community?
- If you were designing interventions to increase civic opportunity, where would you focus?

#### Research Questions
- How might civic opportunity relate to voter turnout or political participation?
- Do areas with more civic opportunity have different policy outcomes?
- What role do religious and fraternal organizations play in civic life?
