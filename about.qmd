## About This Dashboard

The **MapAgora Teaching Dashboard** is powered by the MapAgora datasets, which are derived from IRS tax returns of tax-exempt organizations and data scraped from their websites. The goal is to map civic infrastructure across the United States and provide tools for learning about and exploring civic opportunity.

### Teaching Features

This dashboard was designed as a teaching tool to help users:

- **Understand** the data sources and methodology behind civic opportunity measurement
- **Explore** county-level civic opportunity through interactive map and table visualizations
- **Compare** states and counties using side-by-side comparisons
- **Annotate** counties with personal notes for research or teaching purposes
- **Bookmark** counties of interest for later reference

### Data Source

The underlying data comes from the [MapAgora datasets](https://github.com/snfagora/american_civic_opportunity_datasets), which include:

- **1.7 million+ nonprofit organizations** from IRS records
- **Civic opportunity indicators** derived from web scraping
- **15 organization types** classified using machine learning
- **County and ZIP code-level aggregations**

For the full methodology, see the [Learn](learn.qmd) page or the published paper:

### Browser Data

Your annotations (notes on counties) and bookmarks are stored locally in your browser using localStorage. This means:

- Your data stays on your device
- It persists across browser sessions
- It is not synced across devices
- Clearing browser data will remove your annotations and bookmarks
