## What is Civic Opportunity?

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Definition
**Civic opportunity** refers to the availability of concrete ways for individuals to engage in public life, such as volunteering, attending events, joining organizations, or participating in civic or political action.
:::

Democracy requires people to develop capabilities for participation, such as expressing preferences and negotiating with each other in collective settings. A healthy democracy represents the public and enables people to act together in ways that can build social bonds, hold public officials accountable, and realize shared interests.

Civic opportunity is **not** guaranteed by the size, visibility, or financial resources of any individual organization. Larger or wealthier organizations, such as foundations, hospitals, or universities, may not offer civic opportunities. By contrast, smaller, less-resourced organizations, such as local religious groups or fraternal societies, often serve as the most active providers of civic opportunity.

### The Four Dimensions of Civic Opportunity

MapAgora measures civic opportunity along four dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | How It's Detected |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Membership** | Organizations that allow people to join as members | Links containing "join", "member", "sign up" |
| **Volunteering** | Organizations that offer volunteer opportunities | Links containing "volunteer", "get involved" |
| **Public Events** | Organizations that host events open to the public | Links containing "events", "calendar", "meeting" |
| **Civic/Political Action** | Organizations that enable civic or political participation | Links containing "take action", "justice", "social action" |

Each organization receives a score of 0 or 1 for each dimension. The **civic opportunity score** for an organization is the average of these four indicators (ranging from 0 to 1).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example Calculation
Consider an organization that:

- Offers membership opportunities (1)
- Provides volunteer opportunities (1)
- Hosts public events (1)
- Does NOT offer civic/political action opportunities (0)

**Organization's civic opportunity score** = (1 + 1 + 1 + 0) / 4 = **0.75**

## Data Sources

### IRS Exempt Organizations Business Master File

The foundation of MapAgora is the **IRS Exempt Organizations Business Master File**, a comprehensive registry of all tax-exempt organizations in the United States. This includes approximately **1.8 million organizations** that have incorporated with the IRS to obtain and maintain tax-exempt status.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Types of Organizations in the IRS Registry

| Organization Type | Examples | Tax Code |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| Public Charities | Food banks, universities | 501(c)(3) |
| Private Foundations | Gates Foundation, community foundations | 501(c)(3) |
| Religious Institutions | Churches, mosques, synagogues | 501(c)(3) |
| Advocacy Organizations | ACLU, NRA | 501(c)(4) |
| Labor Unions | AFL-CIO | 501(c)(5) |
| Professional Associations | U.S. Chamber of Commerce | 501(c)(6) |
:::

### Form 990 Filings

Most tax-exempt organizations must file annual returns with the IRS:

| Form Type | Who Files | Information Provided |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Form 990** | Large organizations (>$200K revenue or >$500K assets) | Detailed financial and program information |
| **Form 990-EZ** | Mid-sized organizations ($50K-$200K revenue) | Abbreviated financial information |
| **Form 990-N** | Small organizations (<$50K revenue) | Basic registration only ("postcard") |
| **Form 990-PF** | Private foundations (any size) | Foundation-specific disclosures |

Of the 1.8 million organizations, approximately:

- 460,000 file full Form 990 (990, 990-EZ, or 990-PF)
- 913,000 file only the abbreviated 990-N
- 400,000 are exempt from filing

### Organizational Websites

IRS filings provide limited insight into what organizations actually do. Mission statements are typically brief (average 26 words), and program descriptions are limited (average 110 words).

To supplement this, MapAgora collected text from **1,062,554 organizational websites**, including homepage and "About" page content. Website text averages **1,077 words**, providing substantially richer information for classification.

## Data Collection Methodology

The MapAgora datasets were constructed through a six-step pipeline:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A[Step 1: IRS Master File<br/>Define sampling frame] --> B[Step 2: Parse Form 990<br/>Extract structured data]
    B --> C[Step 3: Find URLs<br/>Bing Search API + IRS records]
    C --> D[Step 4: Verify URLs<br/>Validate organizational websites]
    D --> E[Step 5: Web Scraping<br/>Extract About page text]
    E --> F[Step 6: Classification<br/>ML + Rule-based methods]
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Step Details

**Step 1: Defining the Sampling Frame**
Starting with the IRS Master File ensures coverage of all registered tax-exempt organizations, including those not required to file annual returns (like churches).

**Step 2: Standardizing Form 990 Variation**
Custom XML parsing functions extract consistent information from different form types (990, 990-EZ, 990-PF).

**Step 3-4: Collecting and Verifying URLs**
URLs are obtained through two methods:

1. Extracted from Form 990 filings
2. Automated searches using Bing Search API (using organization name + location)

**Step 5: Web Scraping**
Text extracted from homepages and "About" pages, excluding boilerplate elements (navigation, footers).

**Step 6: Classification**
Two-stage process:

1. **Rule-based** (regular expressions) for civic opportunity detection
2. **Machine learning** (LASSO + XGBoost ensemble) for organizational type classification

## Classification Approach

### Detecting Civic Opportunities

Civic opportunities are identified by scanning organizational website links for specific patterns:

| Civic Opportunity | Regular Expression Pattern |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Membership | `(?<![a-zA-Z])join`, `member`, `sign up` |
| Volunteering | `volunteer`, `get involved`, `getinvolved` |
| Public Events | `events`, `calendar`, `meeting` |
| Civic/Political Action | `take action`, `takeaction`, `justice`, `social(.?)action` |

### Classifying Organization Types

Organization types are predicted using a supervised machine learning model:

- **Training Data**: 9,112 manually labeled organizations
- **Model**: Ensemble combining LASSO and XGBoost
- **Accuracy**: Approximately 90%
- **Features**: Combined text from IRS records and website content

## Understanding the Metrics

### Civic Opportunity Per Capita

For each county or ZIP code, we calculate:

$$\text{Civic Opportunity Per Capita} = \frac{\sum \text{(Organization Civic Scores)}}{\text{Population}} \times 100,000$$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example Calculation
A county has:

- 500 organizations with civic opportunity scores totaling 250
- Population of 500,000

**Civic Opportunity Per Capita** = (250 / 500,000) × 100,000 = **50 per 100,000 residents**
:::

### Civic Opportunity Index (1-5)

The raw per-capita scores are converted to a **quintile-based index**:

| Index | Meaning | Percentile Range |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **1** | Lowest civic opportunity | Bottom 20% |
| **2** | Below average | 20th-40th percentile |
| **3** | Average | 40th-60th percentile |
| **4** | Above average | 60th-80th percentile |
| **5** | Highest civic opportunity | Top 20% |

### Rankings

Each county receives two rankings:

- **State Rank**: Rank among all counties in the same state
- **National Rank**: Rank among all 3,200+ U.S. counties

## Data Limitations

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Caveats
Understanding what the data does NOT capture is just as important as understanding what it does capture.
:::

### What's Missing

The MapAgora dataset does not capture the full spectrum of civic life:

| Missing Category | Why It's Missing |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Informal groups** | Not formally registered with IRS |
| **Mutual aid networks** | Often unincorporated |
| **Online communities** | No physical registration |
| **Fiscally sponsored projects** | Filed under umbrella organizations |

Some civic actors intentionally forgo incorporation to engage more freely in political or faith-based work. These groups are no less civic, but they are structurally difficult to observe using administrative data.

### P.O. Box Exclusions

Approximately **23% of organizations** use P.O. Boxes as their mailing address. These are excluded from the analysis to ensure organizations have a verifiable local presence. This may exclude some legitimate organizations serving rural or vulnerable populations.

### Civic Deserts

Some geographic areas have nonprofit organizations but **no civic opportunity providers** as defined by this framework:

- **3% of counties** have no civic opportunity organizations
- **17% of ZIP codes** have no civic opportunity organizations

These "civic deserts" are shown in gray on the map.

### Measurement Considerations

- **Classification accuracy**: The machine learning model achieves ~90% accuracy, meaning some organizations may be miscategorized
- **Website availability**: Organizations without websites cannot be fully classified
- **Temporal snapshot**: Data reflects a specific point in time (based on IRS filings through 2021)

## Self-Assessment

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Test Your Understanding

**Question 1**: What does a civic opportunity index of "3" mean?
<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
A civic opportunity index of 3 means the county is in the middle quintile (40th-60th percentile) for civic opportunity per capita among all U.S. counties.
</details>

**Question 2**: Why might a large, wealthy organization (like a hospital) have a low civic opportunity score?
<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
Civic opportunity measures whether an organization offers membership, volunteering, public events, or civic action opportunities, not its size or wealth. A hospital may provide healthcare services but not actively engage the public through these civic mechanisms.
</details>

**Question 3**: What are two limitations of using IRS data for measuring civic opportunity?
<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
1. Informal groups, mutual aid networks, and online communities are not captured because they don't register with the IRS.
2. About 23% of organizations with P.O. Box addresses are excluded, potentially underrepresenting rural areas.
</details>

**Question 4**: Why are religious and fraternal organizations particularly important for civic opportunity?
<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
Religious and fraternal organizations account for approximately 80% of civic opportunity providers at the county level. Despite often operating with modest financial resources, they frequently offer multiple forms of civic engagement (membership, events, volunteering) to their communities.
</details>

**Question 5**: How is the civic opportunity score calculated for an individual organization?
<details>
<summary>Click to see answer</summary>
Each organization receives a 0 or 1 for each of four dimensions: membership, volunteering, public events, and civic/political action. The civic opportunity score is the average of these four binary indicators, ranging from 0 to 1.
</details>
